I’ll supervise your implementation during the process and train you to understand and follow the plan throughout your future work.\n\nNote:\n- This is not just a social media plan; social media is only one of the 150 elements\n- A free introductory file is available that explains everything I offer in detail — feel free to contact me to request it\n\nI’m not just a service provider — I’m a dedicated consultant for a client who deserves the best",
